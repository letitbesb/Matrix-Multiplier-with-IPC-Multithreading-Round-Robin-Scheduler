# Matrix-Multiplier-with-IPC-Multithreading-Round-Robin-Scheduler
Matrix Multiplication program in C performing calculations on large matrices using parallelism provided by the Linux process and threads libraries. IPC mechanisms used to create shared memory segment for communication between processes. Round Robin Algorithm Implemented to simulate a uniprocessor scheduler.
